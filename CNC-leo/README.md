# smoothie-cnc-leosay21 upgraded from cnc-ui
CNC control UI for Smoothieboard web interface.  Put into /sd/cnc/

There is a JS event picking the position information twice a second with some nice UI using Three.js

The javascript assumes .gcode files for upload - you may want to change that if your toolchain outputs something else
